# AngularJS: Building and maintaining a large scale application

At Blip we are currently rebuilding all our products and transforming them into single page apps. Application performance and fast releases are key points for the business.

In this talk I will share our current developing process, how do we handle weekly releases, how we manage to have more than 10 teams working on different projects sharing code and how AngularJs eases this process.
